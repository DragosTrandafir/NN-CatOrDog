This Jupyter Notebook project contains a machine learning classification model which predicts whether a pateint with some given health features values given by the user is likely to have diabities or not.


Classification errors appear as numbers in the interval [0,1] and they represent a percentage of misclassified data (eg 0.12 -> 12% error or 0.4301 -> 43% of data is missclassified).

The project is inspired by algorithms and ideas presented in the "Machine Learning Specialization" course, by Andrew Ng, from the Coursera official website.
