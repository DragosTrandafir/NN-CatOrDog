This Jupyter Notebook project contains a machine learning classification model which predicts whether a patient with some given health feature values is likely to have diabities or not.


Classification errors appear as numbers in the interval [0,1] and they represent a percentage of misclassified data (eg 0.12 -> 12% error or 0.4301 -> 43% of data is missclassified).

The project is inspired by algorithms and ideas presented in the "Machine Learning Specialization" course, by Andrew Ng, from the Coursera official website.
